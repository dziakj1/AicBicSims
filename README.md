Simulation code for "Sensitivity and Specificity of Information Criteria" 

This is R and SAS code which was used to do the simulations in the tech report:
Dziak, J. J., Coffman, D. L., Lanza, S. T., and Li, R. (2012). Sensitivity
and specificity of information criteria (Methodology Center Technical Report 12-119).
University Park, PA: The Methodology Center, The Pennsylvania State University. 
Available at http://methodology.psu.edu/media/techreports/12-119.pdf or 
https://peerj.com/preprints/1103/.

The simulation code for normal linear regression and latent class analysis was
written by John Dziak at Pennsylvania State University.  The simulation code 
for factor analysis was written by Donna Coffman and John Dziak.  The latent 
class analysis simulations require SAS for Windows, version 9.1 or higher 
(www.sas.com) and the PROC LCA add-in from The Methodology Center at Pennsylvania 
State University (http://methodology.psu.edu/downloads/proclcalta).  The other
simulations are written in R (cran.r-project.org).
